This project was built by Five teammates, including me. I upload it here as part of my portfolio, and I might continue developing it individually in the future.
Game build can be played by downloading [Hide and Shoot.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s47yT8dtr7yUmdnZ-qebzBHN7NCcmUR_/view?usp=drive_link) and starting the **Hide And Shoot.exe** in the folder.

**NOTE:**

If you want a full game against an AI, it will be located in Local Game. Training mode is just getting a feel of the game. We also have muiltiplayer, so you can try that out with another friend if you like. Just join their lobby name and start the game! There are some bugs that we know of that couldn't be patched in time. However, they are not game breaking.

**HOW TO PLAY:** 

For Local: One person will be Player 1 and the other will be Player 2. Both players will be taking turns owning the camera and the mouse. When the camera is on Player 1, they have control over the mouse and can look for Player 2. When the camera is on Player 2, then they have control over the mouse and can look for Player 1. There are powerups all over the map so have fun! First to kill the other wins the game!

For Multiplayer: The creator of the room will be Player 1 and whoever joins that room will be Player 2. The camera switching will start from Player 1. No guns are activated until the first swap has occured. There is a chance where you may both spawn on each other. You choose your story! Either run away or get ready for a showdown! There are powerups all over the map so have fun! First to kill the other wins the game!
